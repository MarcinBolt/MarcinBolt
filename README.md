## Summary:
Ever since I got my first computer, I have always been fascinated by everything related to it. This interest naturally steered me towards learning programming, to which I now commit myself. I decided to learn full-stack programming because I wanted to know the working of the application from a more complete perspective, which allows for easier collaboration and communication at the junction of back-end and front-end, as well as a better understanding of the complete operation of the application as a whole. 

Personally I like to know how things (including the human maind) works and how it can be improved, optimized to be more efficient. I am interested in personal development - a holistic investment in myself - expanding my knowledge in many areas; soft as well as hard skills. I enjoy reading books on personal development, non-fiction and biographies. I also sometimes reach for fiction. I love a good movie and music - here, too, I don't stop at one genre. I try to keep an open mind, not limiting myself to one point of view. I absorb the world from a broad perspective. As someone who is open-minded, I have a natural ability to adapt to new environments. I like running - also do it for a healthy balance, to clear my mind and keep it in better shape.
