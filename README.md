## Summary about me:
### Hey, my name is Marcin. I've been intensively learning to program in JavaSscript (Full Stack Developer) for over a year now, but in fact ever since I got my first computer, I've always been drawn to anything related to it. I like to know how something works, what mechanisms it is subjected to and think how it can be improved, optimized. I am interested in personal development - a holistic investment in myself - expanding my knowledge in many areas; soft as well as hard skills. I enjoy reading books on personal development, how-to books, non-fiction and biographies. I also sometimes reach for fiction. I love a good movie and music - here, too, I don't stop at one genre. I try to keep an open mind, not limiting myself to one point of view. I absorb the world from a broad perspective. I run as a hobby - I also do it for a healthy balance, to clear my mind and keep it in better shape.
