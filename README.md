## Summary:
From the moment I received my first computer, I have always been fascinated by everything related to it. This interest naturally steered me towards programming, to which I now dedicate myself entirely. I chose to learn full-stack programming in order to understand the operation of an application from a more complex perspective, which makes it easier to cooperate and communicate at the junction of back-end and front-end, as well as to better understand the total operation of the application as a whole.

Personally, I am interested in understanding how things, programs (including the human mind and habits) work, how they can be improved to be more efficient. I am also interested in personal development - holistic investment in myself - expanding my knowledge in many areas; both soft and hard skills. I read books (or listen to audiobooks) on personal development, non-fiction and biographies, and occasionally reach for fiction. I love a good movie and music - here, too, I don't limit myself to one genre. I try to keep an open mind, not limiting myself to one point of view. I absorb the world from a broad perspective. As an open-minded person, I can naturally adapt to new environments. I enjoy running - I also do it for my health, to clear my mind and keep it in better shape.
